## Day 5: January-08-2019

#### Today's Focus: "Virtual Lab Setup"

#### Completed:

- All the Lab Machines has been upgraded to the latest version.
- Snapshots Taken

#### Link to Work: [The Lab](https://github.com/NavinNavi19/Learn-Website-Hacking-Penetration-Testing-From-Scratch/blob/master/Supporting%20Documents/The-Lab.md)

#### Thoughts: 

[Keeweb](https://keeweb.info/) - Free cross-platform password manager compatible with KeePass files and it's light weight accessible from browser. IMO this is the best password manager that I came across.

[Tusk](https://github.com/subdavis/Tusk) - For accessing keePass files from the extension but the need for it is less as manual copy pasting is preferred.

Always Revisit your Google Security to revoke some of the apps access that you don't use anymore.

GitHub gave free access to Private Repositories.

Found a way to quickly edit github markdown files right from the browser using [**stackedit.io**](https://stackedit.io). Also used [PDF to Markdown Converter](http://pdf2md.morethan.io/) to convert some PDF files.

## Day 3: January-06-2019

#### Today's Focus: "Automation In my Web Server Part 2"

#### Completed:

+ Set up custom 404 Error page built to suit my website colors. 
+ Learned a lot of bash coding in trying to fix some errors.

#### Link to Work: [Custom 404 Page](https://vanuss.in/404.shtml) 

#### Thoughts: 

It's a Sunday, so most of the time was spent playing and shopping. As I had a prior plan, I managed to code for 2 hours. But unfortunately, I cannot upload my code to my github repo as I have been coding in my web server. First thing today, created a local git and tried to link it with [**my github account**](https://github.com/NavinNavi19), but I was unable to do it. Tried hard to find a way but I dont have enough time in the planned 2 hours to sit and waste time in this.

Turns out that I dont have enough privileges to my shared web hosting server. Most of the commands were not allowed. After some retries, I gave up my goal and had to look for the alternative's whichever is possible. I was not able to update the ruby version too. The sad part is that I spent most of the time trying to do that.

But finally, when i was reading the cpanel documentation to know more about my privileges to the web server, I came across a [**post**](https://support.hostgator.com/articles/cpanel/custom-error-pages) which helped me to setup [**custom error page**](https://vanuss.in/404.shtml) to my website. As I have already prepared my own 404 page design in Dec. I used the post as a guide to edit .htaccess file to enter some lines of code and uploaded my html file to bring up the custom error page instead of a default page which was looking bad.

After this, I came across a valuable post about time management techniques. [**Pomodoro Timer**](https://pomodoro-tracker.com/) for increasing the prouctivity and [**GTD**](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-getting-things-done-1551880955)(Get Things Done) for planning the things to be done one by one. After going through some videos about them, I was made to believe that this technique might increase the productivity and I did. One more useful link - [**Hack your To do list**](https://lifehacker.com/5986867/david-allen-explains-how-to-master-your-to-do-list)

To do for the next day:
- Add DNSSEC to my Hosting
- Find a way to fix the git errors and ssh via aws.
- Generate the CSR for new Certificate for Secure connection to [**my website**](https://vanuss.in/).

## Day 2: January-05-2019

#### Today's Focus: "Automation In my Web Server Part 1"

#### Completed:
+ Connected to my web server via SSH using keys.
+ Added push notification via api's access token.

#### Link to Work: [My Site](https://vanuss.in/)

#### Thoughts:

Today has been a very busy day. Early morning Cricket, no proper sleep, Outing and Buffet Treat though I managed to find two hours to code.  

As per my plan, I connected to my web server with username and password using putty. But the real problem arises when I try to import keys to connect automatically without any authentication. But I managed to uploade the keys in the respective servers after 30 min of struggle. First part was done as I connected to my server using SSH successfully.

Then I came across a section where it says that I can get notification in my device when any change was done to the server. For that I need to install [**PushBullet**](https://www.pushbullet.com/) to get the access token which is supported. For that I learned basics of [**API**](https://docs.pushbullet.com/) specially flavoured for [**PushBullet**](https://www.pushbullet.com/), then I had to installed [**CURL**](https://curl.haxx.se/) using [**CHOCOLATEY(Package Managers)**](https://chocolatey.org/) in my server to learn about API. 

*[curl -u <your_access_token_here>: https://api.pushbullet.com/v2/users/me]*

Above was the first command I learned to get the details of my API linked user details. This took me almost 20 min to find the exact code. Funny right but thats true. In the end, I found the answer in [**Stack Overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/) as always.

Finally, Added access token in my server to get the notification in my device

To Do :
- Add DNSSEC to my Hosting
- Try to update cpanel Version and utilize all the features.
- Generate the CSR for new Certificate for Secure connection to [**my website**](https://vanuss.in/).

## Day 1: January-04-2019

#### Today's Focus: "Learn Markdown and bring up the Repo site"

#### Completed: 
+ Created Own Daily Log Repo Files
+ Learned Basics of Markdown
+ Brushed up my GIT CLI commands
+ Hosted my Repo Using GH page to [NavinNavi's daily log page](https://navinnavi19.github.io/100-Days-of-Code/)

#### Link to Work: [NavinNavi's daily log page](https://navinnavi19.github.io/100-Days-of-Code/)

#### Thoughts:

I am very excited to start the challenge [**#100DaysofCode**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode) alongside this challenge [**#301DaysOfCode**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23301DaysOfCode&src=tyah). I know its a huge to tackle in the beginning but in the end *if I am not able to do who else can do for me*. The real motivation came from the Twitter Community who are successfully tweeting for Round Two or even Round Three of #100DaysofCode.

Consider I am already familiar with *Git, GitHub, Data Security Technologies and Basic Web Development*. As a starter I followed three github  repositories ([Kallaway](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code), [Jasondown](https://github.com/jasondown/100-days-of-code), [James-Priest](https://github.com/james-priest/100-days-of-code-log)) to created my own [**Daily Log Repo**](https://github.com/NavinNavi19/100-Days-of-Code). I did not directly fork the repo because I decided to learn the markdown language on my own. A quick **brushup of markdown** is covered in this [**Cheatsheet**](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

I imported some of my old local git files using CLI to GitHub faced some small problems but this [**link**](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)
helped me to brush up *git CLI remote pull/push commands*.

After some testing with my [**Template Repo**](https://navinnavi19.github.io/Collection-of-Templates/) using this [**post**](https://nicolas-van.github.io/easy-markdown-to-github-pages/) as a reference. Finally, I learned to quickly host my [**Site**](https://navinnavi19.github.io/100-Days-of-Code/) UP with github pages using Jekyll Theme by [Mattgraham](https://twitter.com/mattgraham).
